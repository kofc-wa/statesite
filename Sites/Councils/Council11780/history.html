					Dignitaries present at the institution included State Secretary Everett J. Roberts; State Advocate Wayne C. Hogan and DD Virgil Hedlund.
					The dignitaries present were State Treasurer Everett J. Roberts, State Warden Wayne Hogan and District Deputy Virgil D. Hedlund.
					Those most responsible for the institution and active in it are Gary Weber, Jim Martin, John Mergens and Fr. Jack Walmesley.
					At our initial meetings with Fr. Walmesley, he challenged us to build on the traditional strengths of the Knights of Columbus
					while adding an element of men's spirituality. Our primary membership drive involved a Sunday afternoon men's spirituality
					reflection conducted by Fr. Walmesley. Since our institution the council has worked to establish a balanced service program 
					of church, community, council, family and youth programs - flavored with this element of spirituality.

					Our council is located on the East Hill of Covington at St. John the Baptist parish.
					This is a new parish - the church building was completed less than 5 months prior to our institution.
					During the formation phase of the parish, all activities were directed by a steering team working closely with Fr. Walmesley.
					One of the team members was Harry J. Tucker Jr.,&nbsp; Harry's service to the Knights of Columbus included the offices of Supreme Warden;
					State Deputy and Vice Supreme Master as well as countless hours of involvement in local councils. 
					Most recently he was a member of Kent Council 8150.

					While still State Deputy, he was elected Supreme Warden by the Supreme Board of Directors for 1980-82.
					He was Supreme Warden during the Centennial Year of the Order and participated in all of those activities. 
					He was appointed Vice-Supreme Master of the Archbishop Francis N. Blanchet Province of the Fourth Degree 1985-89.
					Harry passed away September 18, 1995 - three months prior to the completion of our parish church building.
					As the building architecture was being developed, Harry looked forward to the establishment of a council here. 
					Although he was taken from us, we are proud to honor Harry's service to our order and our parish by instituting a council in his name.
