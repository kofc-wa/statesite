The soldiers led him away inside the palace, that is, the praetorium, and assembled the whole cohort. 
 
They clothed him in purple and, weaving a crown of thorns, placed it on him. 

They began to salute him with, "Hail, King of the Jews!" 
 
and kept striking his head with a reed and spitting upon him. They knelt before him in homage.

Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus inside the praetorium 15 and gathered the whole cohort around him. 
 
They stripped off his clothes and threw a scarlet military cloak 16 about him. 
 
Weaving a crown out of thorns, 17 they placed it on his head, and a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!" 
 
They spat upon him 18 and took the reed and kept striking him on the head. 

And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the cloak, dressed him in his own clothes, and led him off to crucify him

And the soldiers wove a crown out of thorns and placed it on his head, and clothed him in a purple cloak, 
 
and they came to him and said, "Hail, King of the Jews!" And they struck him repeatedly. 
 
Once more Pilate went out and said to them, "Look, I am bringing him out to you, so that you may know that I find no guilt in him." 
 
So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple cloak. And he said to them, "Behold, the man!" 
 
When the chief priests and the guards saw him they cried out, "Crucify him, crucify him!" Pilate said to them, "Take him yourselves and crucify him. I find no guilt in him."
