Think of... 
The love which filled Christ's Sacred Heart during His three hours' agony on the Cross, and ask Him to be with you at the hour of death.<br> 
<a href="http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/matthew/matthew27.htm" target=1>Matthew 27:33</a><br><br></font><font color="#FFAO7A"><span style="font-size:18">
As faithful disciples of Jesus we take his most blessed mother into our homes.&nbsp &nbsp</font><font color="#FFFFFF"><span style="font-size:18">"Standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala. When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple there whom he loved, he said to his mother, "Woman, behold, your son." Then he said to the disciple, "Behold, your mother." And from that hour the disciple took her into his home."<br> 
<a href="http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/john/john19.htm"target=1>( Joh 19,25-27)</a><br><br> 
Stripped of His garments, Jesus is violently thrown down on the Cross.  His hands and His feet are nailed to it in the most cruel way.  Jesus remains silent, because it so pleases His heavenly Father.  He suffers patiently, because He suffers for you.  How do you act in sufferings and trials?  How fretful and impatient, how full of complaints are you! <br>Behold Jesus crucified!  Behold His wounds received for love of you!  His whole appearance betokens love.  His head is bent to kiss you.  His arms are extended to embrace you.  His heart is open to receive you.  Oh what love!  Jesus dies on the Cross, to preserve you from eternal death.
