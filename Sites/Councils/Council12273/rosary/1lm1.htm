 Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him. 
 
 John tried to prevent him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and yet you are coming to me?" 
 
Jesus said to him in reply, "Allow it now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he allowed him. 
 
 After Jesus was baptized, he came up from the water and behold, the heavens were opened (for him), and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove (and) coming upon him. 
 
And a voice came from the heavens, saying, "This is my beloved Son,  with whom I am well pleased."

After all the people had been baptized and Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, heaven was opened 
 
 and the holy Spirit descended upon him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven, "You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased." 
 
 When Jesus began his ministry he was about thirty years of age

I have baptized you with water; he will baptize you with the holy Spirit." 
 
It happened in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan by John. 
 
On coming up out of the water he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit, like a dove, descending upon him.  
 
And a voice came from the heavens, "You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased." 
 
 At once the Spirit drove him out into the desert, 
 
and he remained in the desert for forty days, tempted by Satan. He was among wild beasts, and the angels ministered to him.
