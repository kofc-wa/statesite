                  (1865-1929), the first Columbian Squires circle was
                  instituted in 1925. Membership in the Squires is for Catholic
                  boys between the ages of 12 and 17. Squires' activities are
                  many, varying from spiritual to active service for the Church
                  and community. Each circle elects officer members from their
                  own rank, teaching skills of leadership and
                  responsibility.</FONT>
